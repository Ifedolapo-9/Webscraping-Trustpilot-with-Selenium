## Introduction
Trustpilot is a widely used platform for customer reviews. Scraping data from Trustpilot can provide insights for businesses, data analysis, or research. However, due to the platform's anti-scraping mechanisms, using **Selenium** in combination with **proxies** is necessary to gather data efficiently and without interruptions.

## Features
- Scrapes review titles, ratings, authors, and review content.
- Implements proxy servers to avoid IP bans and enhance data collection efficiency.
- Uses **Selenium WebDriver** for dynamic page interactions and loading.

## Requirements
- **Python** 3.7+
- **Selenium** library
- **WebDriver** (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)
- Proxy servers for IP rotation

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/webscraping-trustpilot-with-selenium.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd webscraping-trustpilot-with-selenium
   ```
3. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Ensure you have **ChromeDriver** or the corresponding WebDriver for your browser. Download it from [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and ensure it is in your system PATH.

## Usage
1. **Set Up Your Proxies**: Add your list of proxies to the script or a separate configuration file as needed.
2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python main_selenium.py
   ```
3. The script will start scraping reviews from Trustpilot, rotating through proxies as specified, and outputting the data.

## Proxy Configuration
- You can configure proxies by modifying the script. Make sure to use reliable proxy servers.
  ```

## Notes
- **Anti-Scraping Measures**: Trustpilot has strict anti-scraping mechanisms. Ensure to use a diverse set of proxies and implement wait times where necessary.
- **Ethical Use**: Always respect the site's `robots.txt` and terms of service. Use this script responsibly.
